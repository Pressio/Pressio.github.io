            **Open-source project aimed at enabling leading-edge projection-based 
            reduced order models (pROMs) for dynamical systems 
            in science and engineering.**

            Projection-based model reduction refers to a class of surrogate models that reduce the number of degrees of freedom in the high-fidelity model through a projection process. This projection step applied to the governing equations often enables one to make stronger performance guarantees (e.g., of structure preservation, of accuracy via adaptivity) than other surrogates like data-fits and perform more accurate a posteriori error analysis (e.g., via a posteriori error bounds or error models).
