                *Pressio is an open-source project aimed at alleviating the intrusive nature of* `projection-based reduced-order models (pROMs) <{filename}/overview/proms.rst>`_ *for large-scale codes. The core of the Pressio project is a header-only C++ library that leverages generic programming to interface with shared or distributed memory applications using arbitrary data-types and diverse programming models. Pressio provides several functionalities and solvers for performing model reduction, such as Galerkin and least-squares Petrovâ€“Galerkin projections.*

		The name comes from the Latin *compressionem*: pressing together, squeezing.

          **Features of the Pressio C++ library include:**
            * Numerous model reduction routines, including Galerkin, least-squares, and windowed least-squares projections
            * Support for arbitrary datatypes via generic programming and custom operations
            * Built-in support to use Eigen, Kokkos, and Trilinos (with more in progress)
	    * Several time integration schemes

          **The Pressio ecosystem also offers:**
            * `pressio4py <https://pypi.org/project/pressio4py/>`_: Python bindings enabling Pressio's C++ library to be used in pure-Python applications.
            * `pressio-tools <https://github.com/Pressio/pressio-tools>`_: A library to compute large-scale SVD, QR, and sample meshes.
            * `pressio-demoapps <https://github.com/Pressio/pressio-demoapps>`_: A suite of 1d, 2d, and 3d demo applications for testing pROMs and hyper-reduction.
