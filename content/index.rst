                *Pressio is an open-source project aimed at alleviating the intrusive nature of* `projection-based reduced-order models <{filename}/overview/proms.rst>`_ *for large-scale codes. The core of the Pressio project is a header-only C++ library that leverages generic programming to interface with shared or distributed memory applications using arbitrary data-types. Pressio provides numerous functionalities and solvers for performing model reduction, such as Galerkin and least-squares Petrovâ€“Galerkin projections.*

          **Features of the Pressio C++ library include**
            1. Numerous model reduction routines, including Galerkin, least-squares, and windowed least-squares projections
            2. Native support for multiple datatypes, including Eigen, Kokkos, and Tpetra
            3. Support for arbitrary datatypes through custom operations

          **The Pressio ecosystem also offers**
            1. `pressio4py <https://pypi.org/project/pressio4py/>`_: Python bindings enabling Pressio's C++ library to be natively used in Python-only applications.
            2. `pressio-tools <https://github.com/Pressio/pressio-tools>`_: A library for large-scale SVD, QR, and sample meshes.
            3. `pressio-demoapps <https://github.com/Pressio/pressio-demoapps>`_: A suite of 1d, 2d, and 3d demo applications for testing pROMs and hyper-reduction.
