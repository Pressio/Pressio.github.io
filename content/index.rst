                <p class="m-text m-default m-big"><i>Pressio is an open-source project aimed at alleviating the intrusive nature of projection-based reduced-order models for large-scale codes. The core of the Pressio project is a header-only C++ library designed to interface with distributed memory applications characterized by arbitrary data-types. This library provides numerous routines and solvers for performing model reduction, such as Galerkin and least-squares Petrovâ€“Galerkin projections.</i></p>

          **Features of the Pressio C++ library include**
            1. Numerous model reduction routines, including Galerkin, least-squares, and windowed least-squares projections
            2. Native support for multiple datatypes, including Eigen, Kokkos, and Tpetra
            3. Support for arbitrary datatypes through custom operations

          **Features of the Pressio project include**
            1. `Python bindings <https://pypi.org/project/pressio4py/>`_ enabling Pressio's C++ library to be natively used in Python-only applications.
            2. The *pressio-tools* library, which contains algorithms required for end-to-end pROM workflows such as distributed SVD. 
            3. A suite of demo applications for testing ROM methodologies
