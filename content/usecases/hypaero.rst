Hypersonic Aerodynamics
#######################

One of our driving use cases for Pressio is for simulations of hypersonic
aerodynamics. Model reduction is necessary because computational models
are widely used in the hypersonic flight regime due to the expense and difficulty 
of flight tests and experiments. The reliance on computational models as well as
the risk tolerances in hypersonic applications requires a greater emphasis on 
trustworthiness of these models. Unfortunately, crucial tasks including 
parameter calibration, uncertainty/error propogation, and (robust) design
optimization require many model evalutations. 

Model reduction with Pressio enables these many query analysis for higher 
fidelity aerodynamic simulations such as finite volume models of the 
Navier-Stokes and Reynolds-Averaged Navier--Stokes (RANS) equations. The
following section contains results obtained using Pressio and the Sandia
Aerodynamics and Reentry Code (SPARC).
