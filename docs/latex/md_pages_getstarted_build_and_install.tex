\begin{DoxyParagraph}{What does this page cover?}
This page describes the dependencies of {\ttfamily pressio} and its installation process. By the end, you should be able to get pressio, install it, and point to the installed headers from your application. 
\end{DoxyParagraph}




\begin{DoxyParagraph}{Overview}
{\ttfamily pressio} is header-\/only, so to use it one does not need to precompile it into a library and linking to it. However, since we use preprocessor directives to conditionally enable/disable code based on target third-\/party libraries, one needs to account for this. See below for the details. 
\end{DoxyParagraph}
\hypertarget{md_pages_getstarted_build_and_install_autotoc_md14}{}\doxysection{Dependencies}\label{md_pages_getstarted_build_and_install_autotoc_md14}
{\ttfamily pressio} contains code that is specific to third-\/party libraries (T\+P\+Ls) to benefit the integration into existing applications. We can distinguish between {\itshape optional} and {\itshape required} dependencies.

\begin{DoxyParagraph}{}
Eigen is the only required dependency because it is the default choice for instantiating the (dense) R\+OM operators and solving the (dense) R\+OM problem. 
\end{DoxyParagraph}


Enabling/disabling specific dependencies is done via the following cmake variables\+: todo fix the autoamtic setting of pressio based on what is selected.

Obviously, the choice of T\+P\+Ls to enable is related to the dependency requirements of your application. For example, if you have an application that relies on Trilinos data structures and want to use {\ttfamily pressio}, then it makes sense to enable the Trilinos dependency. If you have an application that relies on Eigen data structures, then it makes sense to only leave only Eigen on.

Also, some of the cmake variables listed above are connected. For example, if we enable Trilinos then {\ttfamily pressio} automatically enables also Kokkos, B\+L\+AS, L\+A\+P\+A\+CK and M\+PI. The reason for this is twofold\+: (a) to simplify what the user needs to provide; and (b) we belive some of these constraints are necessary.\hypertarget{md_pages_getstarted_build_and_install_autotoc_md15}{}\doxysection{Ok, but what are the steps to get, install and use Pressio in practice?}\label{md_pages_getstarted_build_and_install_autotoc_md15}
We suggest to use the following steps to install the {\ttfamily pressio} headers such that you can then point to it from within your code\+: 
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item 

Clone {\ttfamily pressio}




\item 

Create a build and install subdirectories

 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{cd <where-\/you-\/cloned-\/pressio>}
\DoxyCodeLine{mkdir build \&\& mkdir install}
\end{DoxyCode}
 



~\newline
 
\item 

Use cmake to configure by passing to the comand line the target list of cmake variables to define. For example, if we want to enable support in {\ttfamily pressio} for Trilinos, one would do\+:

 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{cd <where-\/you-\/cloned-\/pressio>/build}
\DoxyCodeLine{cmake -\/D CMAKE\_INSTALL\_PREFIX=../install \(\backslash\)}
\DoxyCodeLine{      -\/D PRESSIO\_ENABLE\_TPL\_TRILINOS=ON ..}
\DoxyCodeLine{make install \# nothing is built, just headers copied to installation}
\end{DoxyCode}
 

This step would process the cmake arguments and copy the {\ttfamily pressio} headers to the install prefix {\ttfamily $<$where-\/you-\/cloned-\/pressio$>$/install}. Note that nothing is built yet because {\ttfamily pressio} is header-\/only.

Since {\ttfamily pressio} is header-\/only, any T\+PL you want to enable is {\bfseries{not}} needed now during the installation of {\ttfamily pressio}, but it is needed when you build any code that {\itshape uses} pressio.

~\newline
 
\item 

Now you point to the installed headers when building your application, and include the {\ttfamily pressio} header {\ttfamily pressio.\+hpp}. For the sake of the argument, imagine a simple main file as follows\+:  
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{preprocessor}{\#include "pressio.hpp"}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{comment}{// ...}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{keywordtype}{int} main()\{}
\DoxyCodeLine{  \textcolor{comment}{// do what you need}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\}}
\end{DoxyCode}
