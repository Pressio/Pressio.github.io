<p>Pro&shy;jec&shy;tion-based mod&shy;el re&shy;duc&shy;tion refers to a class of sur&shy;ro&shy;gate mod&shy;els
that re&shy;duce the num&shy;ber of de&shy;grees
of free&shy;dom in the full-or&shy;der mod&shy;el (FOM) through a pro&shy;jec&shy;tion process.
This pro&shy;jec&shy;tion step ap&shy;plied to the gov&shy;ern&shy;ing equa&shy;tions of&shy;ten en&shy;ables one
to make stronger per&shy;for&shy;mance guar&shy;an&shy;tees
(e.g., of struc&shy;ture preser&shy;va&shy;tion, of ac&shy;cu&shy;ra&shy;cy via adap&shy;tiv&shy;i&shy;ty) than oth&shy;er
sur&shy;ro&shy;gates like da&shy;ta-fits and per&shy;form more ac&shy;cu&shy;rate <em>a pos&shy;te&shy;ri&shy;ori</em>

<p>De&shy;spite these ben&shy;e&shy;fits, the prac&shy;ti&shy;cal chal&shy;lenges of
im&shy;ple&shy;ment&shy;ing mod&shy;el-re&shy;duc&shy;tion tech&shy;niques in large-scale codes of&shy;ten

This im&shy;ple&shy;men&shy;ta&shy;tion strat&shy;e&shy;gy is not prac&shy;ti&shy;cal or sus&shy;tain&shy;able
in many mod&shy;ern set&shy;tings, be&shy;cause in&shy;dus&shy;tri&shy;al sim&shy;u&shy;la&shy;tion codes of&shy;ten evolve rapid&shy;ly,
in&shy;sti&shy;tu&shy;tions may em&shy;ploy dozens of sim&shy;u&shy;la&shy;tion codes for dif&shy;fer&shy;ent analy&shy;ses,
and com&shy;mer&shy;cial codes typ&shy;i&shy;cal&shy;ly do not ex&shy;pose the re&shy;quired low-lev&shy;el
